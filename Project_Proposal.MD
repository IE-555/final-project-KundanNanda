## Road Accidents in Chicago

- **In this project we are going to analyze the road accidents that are occuring in the city of Chicago. All the accidents that are listed in this project are reported crashes and are occured within the city limits of Chicago, IL from 2020 to 2023. As per the Illinois state all the accidents that have a damage property of more than $1,500 are considered as Reproted Accidents.**

## Project Type
 
### Option 2 - Online Data Analysis
> Students may develop their own programming project. In this option, students must identify a source of online data, which will be dynamically imported via Python. The Python code must utilize these data to either make decision support recommendations or provide a detailed analysis of the data. A YouTube video describing the mechanics of the Python code will be required, in addition to a “how-to” guide for running the code. All source code must be submitted, and the course instructor must be able to execute the code without errors.

#### Data Sources
- *For this we have used data from the federal department of Chicago. (data.cityofchicago.org)*
    - *https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/85ca-t3if.json*

#### Analysis Plan
- *From the availabe road accidents data we'll analyze the accident prone areas in the city of Chicago.*

#### Motivation
- *As road accidents are increasing day by day in large cities like Chicago. We've decided to analyze the data.*
